About
=====

pracmln is a toolbox for statistical relational learning and 
reasoning and as such also includes tools for standard graphical 
models. pracmln is a statistical relational learning and reasoning 
system that supports efficient learning and inference in relational 
domains. pracmln has started as a fork of the *ProbCog* toolbox and 
has been extended by latest developments in learning and reasoning 
by the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the University of 
Bremen, Germany.


pracmln was designed with the particular needs of technical systems 
in mind. Our methods are geared towards practical applicability and 
can easily be integrated into other applications. The tools for 
relational data collection and transformation facilitate 
data-driven knowledge engineering, and the availability of 
graphical tools makes both learning or inference sessions a 
user-friendly experience. Scripting support enables automation, and 
for easy integration into robotics applications, we provide a 
client-server library implemented using the widely used `ROS (Robot 
Operating System) <http://www.ros.org/>`_ middleware.

* Markov logic networks (MLNs): learning and inference Fuzzy-MLN 
  reasoning, probabilistic reasoning about concept taxonomies.
  
* Logic: representation, propositionalization, 
  stochastic SAT sampling, weighted SAT solving, etc.


This package consists of an implementation of Markov logic networks 
as a Python module (`pracmln`) that you can use to work with MLNs in 
your own Python scripts. For an introduction into using `pracmln` in
your own scripts, see :doc:`apidoc`.
