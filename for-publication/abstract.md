**Tak: The Computational Toxicological Machine**

**Introduction**: The amount of knowledge in toxicology, even sometimes for a single patient, exceeds the memory and processing capacity of a single human. The pace of increase of this knowledge, as new pharmaceuticals are approved or novel psychoactive substances emerge, exacerbates this issue. Clinical decision support tools have been used in medicine to augment the knowledge base with which physicians make clinical decisions. Medical toxicologists frequently employ online or electronic resources when providing care. These resources expand the toxicologist's knowledge base but not processing capability. 

**Summary** The purpose of this repository is to develop a computational model of toxicologic differential diagnosis using Markov Logic Networks.
